HTML project
For the previous 48 hours, I have been studying HTML basics on the Odin Project.
I covered topics such as: HTML boilerplate, Elements and Tags, Links and Images, and lastly Lists.
This is the end of the lesso project.
I am to write a page for recipes. Using the skills I have learned during the topics I covered on TOP.
